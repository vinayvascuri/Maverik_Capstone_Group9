This GitHub repository encompasses the Maverik Store Sales Forecasting Capstone Project conducted by Group 9 from the University of Utah. The primary objective is to build a time series forecasting model for accurate daily sales estimates of 30 new stores planned by Maverik annually. The project focuses on optimizing resource allocation, aiding financial decision-making, and establishing benchmarks for performance evaluation against projected outcomes. The repository includes data sets, Python scripts for data cleaning and model development, and documentation on project objectives, methodology, and milestones. The final deliverable will be the forecasting model, providing precise estimates for the first year of sales for the new stores.
